# Using Teleport In Vue
The teleport component can be used to move an element or a component to any particular position in the DOM by specifying the target in the 'to' property of the teleport component. The 'to' property accepts any DOM querySelector [class, id]
The teleport also has a disabled property that determines if the wrapped component will be teleported to the specified target
